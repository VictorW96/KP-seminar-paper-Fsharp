## 2. F# Overview

F# is a multi paradigm programming language. That means it takes multiple parts of different code design and puts it together.
Primarily it was designed to be a functional programming language but you can also do pbject oriented programming or imperative programming 
but the last one should only be rarely used and its considered to be bad design. F# was invented by a Microsoft Research Team and is compatible with
the whole .NET Plattform. So you can interact for example with Visual Basic or C#, which makes F# very powerfull for actual application writing. 
This was the main idea, to build a functional programming language, that is integrated into the Microsoft Ecosystem.
Its language features are very similar to [OCaml](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective_CAML) and it was ineed a role model for F#.

### 1. Functional programming basics

The basic concept of functional programing is that the most important structural unit is a function in contrast for example to object oriented programming, where the 
most important structural unit is a class. The abstraction happens through passing basic functions to higher level functions as arguments. 
One goal of functional programming is also to minimze the use of mutable state. So in a functional programming language you only work with immutable data structures.
